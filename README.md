# 🛒 PnP — Cross-Border Collaborative Grocery Engine

**PnP (TM Pick n Pay)** is a full-stack, real-time collaborative grocery shopping application designed for cross-border families between **South Africa (SA)** and **Zimbabwe (ZIM)**. It enables diaspora family members (e.g. in Johannesburg or London) to shop together in real time with relatives back home (e.g. in Harare or Bulawayo) via live video call, shared synchronized cart, multi-currency split payment calculations, and Gemini AI-powered voice & basket recommendations.
